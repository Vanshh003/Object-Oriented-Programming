# Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) repository! This project demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming through various examples and code implementations.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code files demonstrating different OOP concepts.
- `examples/`: Includes example implementations showcasing the use of OOP principles.
- `docs/`: Documentation and explanations of the concepts covered in the repository.

## Features

- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, or class.
- **Inheritance**: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even when they are instances of subclasses.
- **Abstraction**: Provides a simplified view of complex systems by hiding the implementation details.

## Getting Started
